Work experience
======
* **Mar 2023 - Present: Data Operations Manager**
  * *Coyle Personnel, London, UK*
  * Developed and maintained a comprehensive Gross Profit report using Power BI, leveraging ETL techniques and SQL expertise. The report was built using data from the server and served as a crucial tool for directors and managers across the company, enabling trend analysis and informed budgeting decisions. Implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) to restrict profit figures from competing teams.
  * Created a forecasting model using machine learning techniques to predict future Gross Profit for salespeople and teams. Implemented an XGBoost model in Python, utilizing time-series data, which revolutionized the end-of-year process by accurately setting targets for salespeople for the upcoming year.
  * Engineered a data pipeline to streamline aged debtors reporting by utilizing SQL and Power Automate. This solution involved ingesting and processing weekly invoice data from 20 different company databases, storing weekly snapshots of the aged debt situation in a centralized database. The consolidated data was then used to generate a Power BI report, providing detailed analysis of credit control metrics.
  * Led a large-scale data migration project, successfully transitioning the company's payroll and sales software simultaneously. Utilized agile methodology to ensure continuous project momentum and leveraged API expertise to configure and test data transfers between systems, ensuring seamless integration and minimal disruption.

* **May 2022 - Mar 2023: Data Operations Analyst**
  * *Coyle Personnel, London, UK*
  * Developed operational workflow automations using Power Automate, frequently creating custom connectors for APIs not natively supported. One notable project automated the tracking of staff computer activity time against their annual leave status, saving the HR department 3 hours per week in manual checks.
  * Cleaned large datasets by implementing Python scripts and VBA macros to automate the process, resulting in project completion 3 months ahead of schedule.
  * Played a key role in the DevOps team for a custom sales SaaS project, leading user acceptance testing and offering business insights to inform the development and feature CI/CD processes.

Projects
======
* **[Predicting Football Match Outcomes](https://github.com/lsp2610/predicting_football_match_outcomes) – Personal Project**
  * Built a predictive model using Python and SQL to estimate the number of expected goals a team will score in a game. The model incorporated features such as rolling averages and game location (home or away), utilizing pandas for data manipulation and XGBoost along with scikit-learn for machine learning.
  * Applied a Poisson model to the predicted expected goals to generate match odds. Compared to Bet365's historic odds (adjusted for margin), my model demonstrated superior performance, as measured by a lower Brier Score.

* **[FM24 Player Valuation Analysis](https://github.com/lsp2610/FM24_player_valuation_analysis) – Personal Project**
  * Utilizing Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn, I created a report that analyses player transfer valuation in Football Manager 2024, performing machine learning modeling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Education
======
* BSc Economics, University of East Anglia, 2019-2022
  * Programming and Data Analysis, Econometric Modelling
