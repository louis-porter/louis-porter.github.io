Under a sky streaked with the colors of a melting sunset, a lone giraffe wandered through an empty carnival. The ferris wheel creaked as it turned slowly in the evening breeze, while the abandoned bumper cars sat in a ghostly silence. Balloons floated lazily in the air, tethered to the ground by strings that seemed to hum with the remnants of a long-forgotten laughter. Somewhere, a distant carousel played a haunting tune, its painted horses frozen mid-gallop. The giraffe, oblivious to the strange surroundings, bent its long neck to nibble on a patch of overgrown grass, the only sign of life in this eerie twilight world.
