In a small town where it always seemed to be autumn, an old typewriter sat in the window of an antique shop, its keys worn smooth by decades of untold stories. The shop itself was a curious place, filled with dusty books, peculiar clocks that ticked in uneven rhythms, and a collection of teacups that never held tea. Outside, the leaves rustled with the sound of secrets, and the air carried the scent of cinnamon and old paper. Every evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, the typewriter would begin to type on its own, spelling out the dreams of those who passed by, the words appearing mysteriously on a yellowed sheet of paper that no one dared to touch.
