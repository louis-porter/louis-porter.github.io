### Introduction

Arsenal enter the summer of 2024 following a highly successful campaign. Despite not securing any silverware, they have established themselves as an elite European team. They narrowly missed out on the Premier League title by a single point to the dominant Manchester City, and even surpassed them in many underlying metrics.

The strategy for this transfer window appears clear: acquire a new central midfielder to complement Declan Rice’s strengths and weaknesses, bring in a new forward to either displace one of the current front three or seamlessly rotate within the lineup, and potentially find a replacement for Aaron Ramsdale. 

Another position of interest is left full-back. Oleksandr Zinchenko was a revelation last season, elevating Arsenal’s play with standout performances such as the home victory against Manchester United, where he controlled the proceedings and was instrumental in Eddie Nketiah's late winner. His punched passes into tight spaces became a hallmark of his play, as did his undeniable passion and experience, which seemed to mature the squad. However, it wasn’t all positive. His well-known defensive frailties, combined with the team’s declining performances toward the end of the season, became more apparent as opponents began to isolate him—most notably at Anfield. He began the season unfit, with Timber starting most pre-season games at left-back before his injury, and he never fully reclaimed the position as the year progressed. Notable poor performances in specific matches, such as the loss to Aston Villa in 2024, significantly shifted fan opinion. Audible groans often followed his actions on the pitch, reflecting the growing dissatisfaction among the supporters.

Takehiro Tomiyasu and Jakub Kiwior shared left-back duties with Zinchenko this season, making this position one of the most unsettled throughout the campaign. The pie chart below illustrates this instability, showing that no player at left-back accumulated more than 50% of the available minutes.
