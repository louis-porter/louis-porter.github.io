### Introduction

Arsenal enter the summer of 2024 following a highly successful campaign. Despite not securing any silverware, they have established themselves as an elite European team. They narrowly missed out on the Premier League title by a single point to the dominant Manchester City, and even surpassed them in many underlying metrics.

The strategy for this transfer window appears clear: acquire a new central midfielder to complement Declan Rice’s strengths and weaknesses, bring in a new forward to either displace one of the current front three or seamlessly rotate within the lineup, and potentially find a replacement for Aaron Ramsdale. 

Another position of interest is left full-back. Oleksandr Zinchenko was a revelation last season, elevating Arsenal’s play with standout performances such as the home victory against Manchester United, where he controlled the proceedings and was instrumental in Eddie Nketiah's late winner. His punched passes into tight spaces became a hallmark of his play, as did his undeniable passion and experience, which seemed to mature the squad. However, it wasn’t all positive. His well-known defensive frailties, combined with the team’s declining performances toward the end of the season, became more apparent as opponents began to isolate him—most notably at Anfield. He began the season unfit, with Timber starting most pre-season games at left-back before his injury, and he never fully reclaimed the position as the year progressed. Notable poor performances in specific matches, such as the loss to Aston Villa in 2024, significantly shifted fan opinion. Audible groans often followed his actions on the pitch, reflecting the growing dissatisfaction among the supporters.

Takehiro Tomiyasu and Jakub Kiwior shared left-back duties with Zinchenko this season, making this position one of the most unsettled throughout the campaign. The pie chart below illustrates this instability, showing that no player at left-back accumulated more than 50% of the available minutes.

Let’s now analyse the performances of the three players who played the most left-back minutes, beginning with Zinchenko himself.

<img src='/images/zinchenko-pizza.png'>

The pizza chart highlights Zinchenko as one of the best ball progressors among defenders. He also demonstrates great attacking prowess, frequently entering the penalty area and creating significantly more expected assists than average. Surprisingly, he excels in defensive metrics as well, particularly in aerial duel win percentage, where he ranks in the 78th percentile—a notable result given that he typically appears to struggle in aerial duels based on the eye-test. However, one glaring weakness is his poor performance in generating turnovers and avoiding errors that lead to shots. This aligns with his performance this season, where his previously composed and intelligent passing seemed to deteriorate into a more forced and risky approach, often resulting in trouble. Regardless of his in-possession strengths, it would appear that Arteta has lost faith in the man.

Now, let’s take a look at Jakub Kiwior. The Polish international became a regular in the side in early February, where he started 12 games in a row - I would expect Kiwior enjoyed a more regular role in the side than he may have anticipated at the start of the year.

The pizza chart below shows a balanced, if unremarkable, performance with no clear standouts, except for his effectiveness in tackling dribblers. He provided a very different option compared to Zinchenko, effectively functioning as a centre-back on the left side of the defence, which contributed to Arsenal's formidable defensive record in 2024. However, his attacking deficiencies are evident in the graph. Additionally, when deployed in an inverted role, he often seemed uncomfortable, as highlighted by his half-time substitution in the loss away at Craven Cottage. While Jakub Kiwior is a valuable squad member, I believe his rotational minutes should primarily come at centre-back rather than full-back next season.

Takehiro Tomiyasu struggled with injuries this season, making it difficult for him to string together consecutive starts. However, when he did play, his impact was noticeable. If Zinchenko and Kiwior represent opposite ends of the spectrum (though I don't necessarily think they do), Tomiyasu would be in the centre. His strength lies in his versatility, often adapting to the positional needs of the situation. He is a great passer and a reliable recovery defender. The pizza chart highlights his strengths in possession but also indicates that he is not the most active or aggressive defender, with his attacking output being relatively uninspiring. Tomiyasu is an invaluable squad member, capable of playing anywhere across the backline. However, would I want him to be our starting left-back next season? I'm unsure.

<img src='/images/tomiyasu-pizza.png'>

Jurrien Timber complicates matters. He looked fantastic in the limited minutes we did get to see from him this season, providing dynamism and strong technical proficiency with the ball up and down the left flank, roaming inwards at times. I believe he will be almost like a new signing next season, but I am not certain that the plan is for him to be the starting left back.

One profile the Arsenal squad lacks is a wide outlet from defence. While Ben White provides a great overlapping threat, he does not serve as a true wing outlet. Acquiring a full-back who can provide width on the left could enhance the overall performance of the squad, potentially improving the left-side dynamics, which were relatively poor compared to the right-side this season. It would mean Martinelli and Trossard could get closer to goal, emphasising their strengths, and also mean that Rice or his midfield partner would play a deeper role. This implies a move to a double-pivot next season, which once again I believe gets the best out of players like Rice and Martinelli. Let’s next look at how we identify wide outlets from the left-back position.



### Identifying Wide Outlet Left-backs

What constitutes a wide outlet? A wide outlet in football refers to a player who excels in receiving the ball in isolated situations, beating defenders, and providing good service into the box. Arsenal already boasts one of the best wide outlets in the world with Bukayo Saka. Other notable examples include Vinicius Junior and Mohamed Salah. These players are primarily forwards, and modern football trends have leaned towards using forwards as wide outlets, with full-backs playing a bigger role in build-up play and defensive transitions. However, having a left-back who can provide attacking width would complement Arsenal's existing squad. History has shown that full-backs can also be effective wide outlets; players like Jordi Alba, Reece James, Joao Cancelo and Jeremie Frimpong (this season) have exemplified this role in the past.

Let’s look at the metrics we can use to try and capture this specific profile:

- Progressive Passes Received: This metric is a hallmark of all good wide outlets. It indicates that the player frequently receives passes that advance the team up the pitch. This also suggests that the player is skilled at creating space for themselves and can effectively receive the ball in isolated situations.
- Progressive Carries: Good carrying ability is often associated with these sorts of players, being able to pick the ball up and drive towards the box is a behaviour that you would expect to see often, and this metric encapsulates that pattern of play.
- Touches in Attacking 3rd: Following similar logic from the previous bullet point, touches in the attacking third suggest that the player is involved in attacking situations - this is particularly relevant as we are looking at defenders who act as a wide attacking option.
- Carries into Penalty Area: This is a key metric for any good wide player. When they beat their defender on the wing, they often get a clear path into the box, which creates dangerous scoring chances. This highlights one of the main responsibilities of players in this role.
- Successful Take-ons: This represents the proficiency in beating a player one-on-one. Which you would expect these players to have to do regularly.
- Key Passes: These players are expected to create scoring opportunities for their teammates and contribute significantly to the attack. Passes that lead to shots are a strong indicator of how effectively they are converting dangerous situations into goal-scoring chances.

We can use these metrics to identify defenders who would offer a good wide threat, using data from the top 5 European leagues (Opta via fbref), I have created an aggregated score using those statistics to highlight the defenders with at least 900 minutes that may be of interest to Arsenal.



### Target Analysis


##### Alphonso Davies

It may come as a surprise that Alphonso Davies is only 22 years old, as it feels like he has been a mainstay in top-level European football for ages. This speaks to his exceptional talent and ability to adapt to elite competition, having even won a Champions League medal as a teenager. However, with Davies’ contract expiring next summer and reported interest from Real Madrid, it is anticipated that he might be available for a reduced transfer fee.

His talents are immediately evident: electric pace and the ability to go past defenders with ease. A prime example is an assist from the COVID-ball era, where he effortlessly dismantled Barcelona's defence and set up Joshua Kimmich for an easy tap-in (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-nOOk-bacs). This snippet of play perfectly illustrates what we are seeking in a wide outlet.

Below is a pizza chart illustrating his overall performance as a full-back. It highlights his excellence in progressing the ball and creating dangerous chances for his team, despite playing in only 22.9 matches this season. While his defensive metrics are not particularly impressive and his duelling performance needs further analysis, excelling in duels is a key requirement for any recent Arsenal signing. Additionally, he struggles with ball retention and tends to commit errors, possibly due to his riskier playing style, which is certainly a concern.

<img src='/images/davies-pizza.png'>

The chart below focuses on the metrics we identified earlier. Davies excels in all of them, consistently performing above the 90th percentile. Notably, he is in the 100th percentile for successful take-ons, indicating that he is among the best in the world at completing take-ons as a defender.

<img src='/images/davies-bar.png'>

These charts reinforce that Davies is a world-class wide threat from deep, excelling in carrying and dribbling, and effectively advancing the team up the pitch or directly into the box. Compared to other defenders, he is an elite chance creator. While he may not be the most efficient defender or the most secure in possession, his strengths could be prioritised and his weaknesses mitigated, especially with a player like Declan Rice patrolling his side of the pitch.

His age and potential availability make him a highly intriguing option, Transfermarkt currently values him at €50.00m, and in my opinion that represents great value. He stands out as the top-performing left-sided defender based on the aggregated score mentioned earlier, second only to Jeremie Frimpong, who plays on the right flank. Additionally, Davies could provide valuable rotational minutes on the right flank due to his left-footedness and skill set, which closely resembles aspects of Saka’s game.


##### Alejandro Balde

Alejandro Balde is more of an unknown prospect at just 19 years old (born in 2003!). While he hasn't had the opportunity to establish himself as much as Davies, he demonstrates similar strengths with his fantastic athleticism and ability to carry the ball forward at pace.

The chart below illustrates the similarities and differences between Balde and Davies. Balde excels at entering the penalty area, ranking in the 97th percentile among defenders. He is also highly effective at progressing the ball, likely favouring carrying over passing. While he tends to make errors, he does not give the ball away as much as Davies. His output of tackles and interceptions is extremely low, ranking in the 2nd percentile, which could indicate his advanced role at Barcelona and a more passive defensive approach. When he does engage, he performs relatively well in tackling dribblers and tends to commit few fouls. However, his aerial ability is not very impressive.

<img src='/images/balde-pizza.png'>

When evaluating the wide outlet metrics, Balde performs at an elite level in most of them. He is in the 99th percentile for progressive carries, progressive passes received, and carries into the penalty area. This indicates that he frequently receives the ball high and wide and then drives it into dangerous positions. His strong performance in successful take-ons complements this, suggesting he is a formidable dribbler in the final third. However, compared to the other metrics, he doesn’t stand out in key passing. Balde is likely more of a dangerous carrier than a passer when creating chances, which is not a problem but suggests that Davies offers a more varied attacking threat.

<img src='/images/balde-bar.png'>

Balde is a promising option at just 19 years old with plenty of room for growth. Transfermarkt currently values him at €40.00m, and given Barcelona's frequent need to sell players, a sensible deal could likely be made. However, there are shortcomings in his statistical profile; he is not the most active or effective defender, which means the issues perceived with Zinchenko might not be resolved with Balde's arrival. Additionally, his youth could be a concern for Arsenal, as they aim for the Premier League title next season and may not have the luxury to allow a player to learn and develop, especially in a new and more demanding league. While Balde is certainly one to watch, he presents a considerable amount of risk.


##### Álex Grimaldo

Álex Grimaldo offers a wealth of experience that sets him apart from his predecessors. At 27, he boasts significantly more playing time, which is evident in his sharp footballing intellect. Fresh off an extraordinary season, Grimaldo played a crucial role in Leverkusen's stunning campaign. Defying all expectations, they went undefeated and broke Bayern Munich's long-standing dominance in the Bundesliga.

Grimaldo frequently positions himself high and wide on the left flank, often functioning as a winger in Xabi Alonso’s 3-4-3 system. What sets him apart from players like Davies and Balde is his unique tendency to drift into central areas when opportunities present themselves. This roaming role underscores his intelligence and flexibility, making him a standout player.

The pizza chart provides a clear snapshot of Grimaldo’s profile: a highly effective attacker with sharp intelligence both on and off the ball, yet with notable defensive weaknesses. He ranks in the 100th percentile for expected assists and the 98th percentile for penalty area entries, also showcasing above-average performances in all possession-focused metrics. Additionally, Grimaldo is in the 95th percentile for fouls committed, which may highlight his intelligence and experience in avoiding unnecessary fouls.

However, his defensive metrics tell a different story. Grimaldo performs poorly in possession-adjusted tackles and interceptions, as well as in his aerial duel win percentage, ranking in the 10th percentile for both. He also falls into the lower half of defenders for successfully tackling dribblers. These statistics suggest that Grimaldo may not be a strong defender.
It's important to consider that his role at Leverkusen is more akin to that of an attacker, supported by three central defenders. Despite this, Arteta’s recent preference for robust duellers and defenders could mean that Grimaldo’s defensive shortcomings might be a significant concern.

<img src='/images/grimaldo-pizza.png'>

Next, examining the wide outlet metrics reveals that Grimaldo excels in most areas, with a slight drop-off in successful take-ons. The graph illustrates that Álex Grimaldo is more of a passer than a carrier, exhibiting elite levels for touches in the attacking third, receiving progressive passes, and making key passes.

This focus on passing over dribbling might not be a problem, especially if he pairs up with Martinelli. With Martinelli taking on more of the dribbling responsibilities, Grimaldo can concentrate on delivering dangerous passes into the box—a skill that Martinelli might not emphasise as much.

<img src='/images/grimaldo-bar.png'>

Valued at €45.00m (Transfermarkt), Grimaldo might not offer the same long-term value as the younger options. However, with Arsenal aiming for immediate success, his experience and fit for a possession-focused team make him a compelling and balanced choice. Nonetheless, his defensive shortcomings should be considered, especially since he would transition from a wing-back role to a back four system.


##### Quentin Merlin

Quentin Merlin could be considered a relative unknown when compared to the previous 3 targets, although he has racked up over 5,700 minutes in his short career, only being 21 years of age. Coming through the Nantes academy, it was this season that he began to establish himself to the wider public, joining Marseille in January and becoming an ever-present in their starting lineup. He is fantastic at set pieces and crossing, a good crosser is something that Arsenal lack, and with Havertz and other tall strikers linked to the club, it may be a sensible idea to begin to explore this strength.

Now, he may not represent the calibre of player that Arsenal should be targeting if they aim to win the Premier League next season, but his statistical profile this season shone when using the average metrics score I calculated and I believe further analysis is warranted.

The pizza chart highlights that Merlin is a highly attack-focused full-back. He excels in all attacking and possession metrics and notably performs exceptionally well in turnover metrics, ranking in the 97th percentile. This is undoubtedly an attribute that Arteta would admire—a player who rarely loses possession cheaply. Merlin is also excellent at progressing the ball and creating danger and chances for his teammates, standing out among defenders in these areas.

However, similar to Grimaldo, Merlin is not the strongest defender. He performs poorly in aerial duels, and at only 5’7”, he could be seen as a vulnerability in the backline.

<img src='/images/merlin-pizza.png'>

Merlin also mirrors Grimaldo's performance in wide outlet metrics, excelling in most areas with the exception of successful take-ons. His proficiency in crossing indicates that he is more of a passer than a dribbler, even though he is also adept at dribbling.

<img src='/images/merlin-bar.png'>

Transfermarkt values him at just €10.00m, reflecting the possibility that he may not yet meet Arsenal's required level. However, he could represent an intriguing option, especially if the long-term plan involves playing Timber at left-back. He would offer a completely different style and bring a new dynamic to the team that Arteta currently lacks.



### Conclusion

Overall, I believe Alphonso Davies is the best transfer target for Arsenal. Arguably the top attacking left full-back in the world, Davies showcases the skills of a forward when challenging defenders. His athleticism fits well with the squad's preference for strong athletes, and he brings a wealth of experience at the highest levels of European football. Most importantly, he knows how to win trophies. Given the uncertainty surrounding his contract and future, this could be the perfect opportunity for Arsenal to secure a reasonable deal for a player that can get you off of your seat.
