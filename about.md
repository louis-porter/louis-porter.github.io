I am 24 years old and based in Essex, UK. I work as a data analyst for a sports betting platform provider called Kambi and work in their London office.

I have a passion for sports analytics, particularly in football; I am a passionate Arsenal fan and a massive Fantasy Football nerd (I managed to come 11th in the world in 2024!).

I have lots of experience in data visualisation and also data science techniques such as machine learning and predictive modelling.
